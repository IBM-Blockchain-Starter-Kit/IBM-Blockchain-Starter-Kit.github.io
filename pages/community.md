## Feedback and Questions

Weâ€™re extremely interested in your feedback about how we could make starter kit even better, so please do get in touch via [our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/IBM-Blockchain-Starter-Kit/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).

## Issues

{% include warning.html content="this is a **prototype** that is currently under development by the IBM Blockchain team. As a result, it may dramatically change, have major bugs, completely fail to work, or disappear altogether. There is **no** officially provided support for this project; any bugs that you report may go unfixed for a longer period of time than you're comfortable with. If you're happy with all of that, then please carry on reading!" %}

If you encounter any problems, it's worth checking whether there is already an issue open. We track track issues across all the starter kit repositories using [ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/ibm-blockchain-starter-kit/ibm-blockchain-starter-kit.github.io/boards?repos=137356912,137370280,137372062,137372247,137376058,137474815,143315611). If there is not already an issue open, please create one and include as much detail as possible to help us track down the problem.

## Contributing

{% include callout.html content="We welcome contributions!" type="primary" %} 

There should be a contributing guide in each of the repositories in [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Starter-Kit), for example the [build-lib contributing guide](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Starter-Kit/build-lib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you have any questions, especially if you're about to start on a large piece of work, please get in touch.
