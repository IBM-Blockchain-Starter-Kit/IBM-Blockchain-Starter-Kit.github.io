The starter kit provides several bootstrap repositories to provide a basis for creating new blockchain projects.

These projects can be used with the toolchain templates and supplement the existing samples. You may also be interested in the [Yeoman generator for Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-fabric) as an alternative way to bootstrap new projects.

There are several types of bootstrap projects:

## API

There is currently one API repository, [api-bootstrap](https://github.com/Blockchain-Kit/api-bootstrap) which provides a bootstrap REST API server. The REST API server is built with express.js and includes a simple `/health` check endpoint. It includes a Swagger UI and uses the mocha framework for testing.

## Chaincode

There are currently two chaincode repositories which provide bootstrap chaincode implementations in Go and Node.js respectively:

-   [chaincode-bootstrap](https://github.com/Blockchain-Kit/chaincode-bootstrap)
-   [nodejs-chaincode-bootstrap](https://github.com/Blockchain-Kit/nodejs-chaincode-bootstrap)
