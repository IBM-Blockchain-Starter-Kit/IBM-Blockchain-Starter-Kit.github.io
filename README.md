# IBM Blockchain Starter Kit Documentation

The starter kit documentation is hosted using GitHub pages at [https://blockchain-kit.github.io/](https://blockchain-kit.github.io/) using the [Jekyll Doc Theme](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll).

All the documentation is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) in files under the **pages** directory.

To add a new page, you may also want to include it in a sidebar, which you can find under the **\_data/sidebars** directory.

For more details, including how to build the documentation locally, read the Jekyll Doc Theme's [getting started guide](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html).
